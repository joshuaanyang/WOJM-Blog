        <p>I seem to have taken the phrase <strong>"the is your oyster"</strong>quite literally.</p>
        <p>I graduated a mechanical engineer and my passion for problem-solving led me to become a python developer (I will gladly help you debug your codes. Just send a message.) I am also a free-lance fullstack engineer and very quite recently a blogger.</p>
        <p>In my defense, being a Divergent just seemed so much cooler plus my ever turning brain would not allow me settle on just one field</p>
        <p>In my free time, I read, and I write as well -if you have read any of <strong>Brandon Sanderson's works</strong> or <strong>The Warded Man Chronicles</strong>, please reach out. Signed Your Future Best Friend.</p>
